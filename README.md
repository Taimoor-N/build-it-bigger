# Build it Bigger
This app displays jokes, with/without ads in the Free/Paid versions. It is composed of four modules:
* Java Library that provides jokes
* Google Cloud Endpoints (GCE) module that serves jokes from Java Library
* Android Library that contains the activity to display jokes
* Android app that fetches jokes from the GCE module and passes them to the Android Library for display

This is one of my projects for the [Android Developer](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801) course on Udacity.
